Current state;

WP installed.

TwentySixteen theme used;

-This is a main WP theme, so is the easiest to get fast support with online.  Once we tune it extensively, we can duplicate it and make it our own theme.  Starting with this will make things fast.
-Current stage is the removal of all the junk we don't need, and shifting things about to get a general shape and structure.
